In this project, we’ll be using all of the collective Foundations and C# skills gained to create a console application that allows a user to manage inventories of items.

Data will be stored in JSON format.
Users must be able to create, read, update, and delete objects.
The class and attribute names used in this application will be generic, making it versatile for different use cases and easily extended.
